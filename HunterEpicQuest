Yesterday, i've won the Ancient Petrified Leaf (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=14524/vartrus-the-ancient) but the NPC'Vartrus the Ancient'(http://www.wowhead.com/npc=14524/vartrus-the-ancient) seems to be not scripted, my Charakters name is 'Tyrandewhisp' and it's on Warsong (there is no issue tracker i can find) thanks for your reply.
